# ðŸ”¥ SOLID Principles in Object-Oriented Design

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles are the foundation of clean architecture and object-oriented design.

## ðŸ“– What is SOLID?

**SOLID** stands for:

- **S** - Single Responsibility Principle
- **O** - Open/Closed Principle
- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle
- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle
- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle

## ðŸ§© Principle Breakdown

### ðŸ”¹ S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
---

### ðŸ”¹ O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
* Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
---

### ðŸ”¹ L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
* Objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the program
* An object of a subclass should be able to access all the methods and properties of the superclass.
---

### ðŸ”¹ I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
* A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesnâ€™t use, or clients shouldnâ€™t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
---

### ðŸ”¹ D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
* Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
